NicheFilms
made this project because i love good movies and wanted a simple way to discover, rate, and keep track of what i’ve watched. 
i built nichefilms as a fun side project—just a  movie site for anyone who wants to browse, save favorites, and see what’s trending.
it’s not all that but something simple to help track my favourite movies. hardcoded for now, will add actual movie info with api calls soon
